# My Nand2Tetris Experience

This repo just documents the code and projects I did when learning the course Nand2Tetris.  I think it's a great way to learn about the inner workings of a computer and highly recommend it to anyone interested in computer science.
The repo won't have everything at first because I am committing as I go along.  Hopefully, the code I put out can help some learners out when they get stuck.
Please note that not all files will be made in the most efficient way possible.  I just commit the first solution that works.  I also upload my notes too, although they might not make sense to other readers.
